                <hr />
                <h2 id="toc0"><span>Basic Schools</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Yodotai Legionnaire (Warrior)</span></h3>
<p>The Legionnaire serves as the foundation of Yodotai armies and is by far the most common type of Yodotai Warrior. He trains from childhood to become a soldier who will prove worthy of fighting alongside legends. The training procedure prepares the Legionnaire for all situation and drills the maneuvers into his head. The Legionnaires instinctively know how to react to every military situation and do not falter in the face of the greatest of terrors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefit:</strong> +1 Agility</li>
<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> 4.5</li>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Battle, Defense, Horsemanship, Lore: Yodotai History, Spears (Pilum), Swordmanship, any one Skill.</li>
<li><strong>Outfit:</strong> Lorica segmenta, gladius, shield, 2 pila, sandals, tunic, toga, travel pack, 5 copper.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="techniques"><strong>Techniques</strong></h6>
<h5 id="rank-1-tortoise-formation">Rank 1: Tortoise Formation</h5>
<p>You do not receive penalties to your Attack Rolls as a result of carrying any type of Yodotai shield. You receive a bonus to your Armor TN equal to your Insight Rank while using a scutum in the Full Defense Stance. As a Free Action you may spend a Void Point to grant this bonus to all allies using scutum in the Full Defense Stance within 10’ for a number of rounds equal to your Class Rank.</p>
<h5 id="rank-2-in-close-quarters">Rank 2: In Close Quarters</h5>
<p>In any round in which you switch from the Full Defense Stance to the Full Attack Stance you gain +1k0 to your Attack Rolls. As a Free Action you may spend a Void Point to grant this bonus to allies within 10’ wielding a gladius who have changed from the Full Defense Stance to the Full Attack Stance this round.</p>
<h5 id="rank-3-deadly-strike">Rank 3: Deadly Strike</h5>
<p>You may make attacks with Yodotai and Warrior weapons as a Simple Action.</p>
<h5 id="rank-4-wedge-formation">Rank 4: Wedge Formation</h5>
<p>While you are in the Attack Stance you gain Reduction equal to your Class Rank.

<h5 id="rank-5-with-my-brothers">Rank 5: With My Brothers</h5>
<p>You no longer need to spend Void to grant the benefits of your Rank 1 and 2 Class Techniques to your allies and the range of the benefit is extended to 30’. All allies wielding Yodotai weapons within 30’ also add +1k0 to their Damage Rolls. This bonus is not cumulative with additional rank 5 Legionnaires present within the same radius.</p>
<h3 id="toc2"><span>Yodotai Mercenary (Warrior)</span></h3>
<p>The Mercenary serves in foreign armies and fights alongside their warriors. While performing his best for those who hire him, he learns more about each society. Once a Mercenary believes he has a firm grasp on target nation's culture and character, he returns to the Yodotai main armies and shares this knowledge with his people. Thanks to the Yodotai Mercenary, the Yodotai rarely face a completely different enemies.</p>

</ul>

<h5 id="rank-2-stranger-in-a-foreign-land">Rank 2: Stranger in a Foreign Land</h5>
<p>You gain a +1k0 to Battle, Intimidation and Courtier Rolls. If you pose a hypothetical scenario to an opponent after 5 minutes of conversation you may make a Contested Courtier (Manipulation) / Awareness Roll against them to determine what tactics they might use to solve such a situation.</p>

You may spend a Void Point on first meeting someone to gain a Free Raise on any rolls to gain their favor or make a good impression for the next 24 hours.</p>
<h5 id="rank-5-hoplon-bash">Rank 5: Hoplon Bash</h5>
<p>You may use your shield to perform an attack as a Complex Action while in the Full Defense Stance. Roll your Agility/Brawling (Shield Bash) against a target’s Armor TN, if successful you inflict damage with your shield as a 1k2 melee weapon. The target of a successful shield bash is also subject to a Knockdown Maneuver and must roll to resist Knockdown as normal.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Advanced Schools</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc4"><span>Yodotai Berserker (Warrior)</span></h3>
<p>The Yodotai Berserker throws himself into the thik of battle with little regard for danger. He can do this because of his absolute faith in his comrades and ancestors. He knows that if he performs well in combat, the greatest heroes of the Yodotai will praise his actions and come to his head. Despite the name, the Berserker does not lose control of himself in battle. This does not make him any less deadly than a berserker who gives in to animal instinct, however.</p>
<h6 id="requirements">Requirements:</h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rings/Traits:</strong> Earth 4, Fire 4</li>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Battle 5, Two weapon skills at 5</li>

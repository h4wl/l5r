<li>1-3 Born of Darkness: Roll on Table 1</li>
<li>4-8 Fallen from Grace: Roll on Table 2</li>
<li>9-0 Omens &amp; Portents: Roll on Table 3</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc0"><span>Table 1: Born of Darkness</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll result</p>
<ul>
<li>1-3 Your father was a minor functionary in the entourage of an Imperial Herald. When your lord was killed by bandits, he survived, and the Lost accepted him into their ranks. He meant only to survive, but their acceptance gave him the first true sense of belonging he had ever known. You gain the Perceived Honor Advantage.</li>
<li>4-6 Your parents were among those who first flocked to Daigotsu’s banner, and you were among the first born in the City of the Lost. You the Fame Advantage and 1 free Rank in a Weapon Skill of your choice.</li>
<li>7-9 Your mother was consumed by the Lying Darkness, yet somehow managed to give birth to you without passing on her affliction. Or did she? You gain the Crafty Advantage.</li>
<li>0 Your parents were members of the Unbroken, a group of Tainted ronin who sought to purge their corruption by killing others that possessed it. You, however, embraced your strength and cast aside their weakness. You gain the Strength of the Earth Advantage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Table 2: Fallen from Grace</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll result</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 Your family once served the Crab, but an ancestor was corrupted in the line of duty and rather than be consigned to death, he embraced his fate. You gain the Large Advantage and 1 free rank in the Heavy Weapons Skill, but also gain a Sworn Enemy among the Crab.</li>
<li>3-4 Your family was once part of the Mantis, but a voyage through the Sea of Shadow led to corruption and madness. You gain one rank of the Luck Advantage and 1 free Rank in the Skills of Chain Weapons and Sailing, but gain a Sworn Enemy among the Mantis.</li>
<li>5-6 Your family once claimed membership among the Phoenix, but your ancestor’s love of secrets and lust for knowledge overwhelmed him, leading him to corruption. You gain the Forbidden Knowledge Advantage and 1 free Rank in a Lore Skill of your choice, but gain a Sworn Enemy among the Phoenix.</li>
<li>7-8 The Scorpion once considered your family loyal vassals, but study of dark secrets led to your ancestor’s corruption and he was sanctioned by the clan. You gain the Dangerous Beauty Advantage and 1 free Rank in the Stealth Skill, but gain a Sworn Enemy among the Scorpion.</li>
<li>9-0 Your ancestor was once a Unicorn, but the call of the fallen Moto was unusually strong within his soul and he willingly rode to the Shadowlands. You gain the Gaijin Gear Advantage and 1 free Rank in the Horsemanship Skill, but gain a Sworn Enemy among the Unicorn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Table 3: Omens &amp; Portents</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll result</p>
<ul>
<li>1-3 You were taken from your family as an infant-stolen by the Bloodspeaker Cult, who felt you were a child of prophecy. You never embraced their ways, however, and eagerly betrayed them to the Lost at the first opportunity. You gain the Touch of the Spirit Realm Advantage.</li>
<li>4-6 You were abandoned at a monastery as a child, an unwelcome burden on your parents. Your years in the monastery were unpleasant and punishing, but the doctrine of strength and power in the Order of the Spider appealed to you, and you were among Roshungi’s fi rst adherents. You gain the Dark Paragon Advantage.</li>
<li>7-9 As a child you suffered from visions. Others thought you were possessed by demons and eventually you were abandoned by your family. The Lost never questioned your value, however, and let you earn your place among them. You gain the Ishiken-do Advantage.</li>
<li>0 The other Lost found you as a child, surviving alone in the Shadowlands. No one understands how this was possible and you have no memory of those years. Sometimes, however, you have half-remembered dreams that give you glimpses of what happened… or what will happen. You gain the Inner Gift Advantage.</li>

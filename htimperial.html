<ul>
<li>1-2 Shameful Past: Roll on Table 1</li>
<li>3-7 Illustrious Past: Roll on Table 2</li>
<li>8-0 Mixed Blessings: Roll on Table 3</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc0"><span>Table 1: Imperial Families Shameful Past</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll Result</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 Your ancestor committed a very unfortunate act, but your family’s political power allowed it to be covered up… so far. You gain the Dark Secret Disadvantage.</li>
<li>3-4 Your ancestor imposed the Imperial will against a troublesome member of the Great Clans, and the act has not been forgotten. You gain a 4-point Sworn Enemy in one of the Great Clans.</li>
<li>5-6 Your ancestor was exiled from the courts after an unfortunate failure. You start with 0.0 Glory and Allies cost you 1 additional Experience Point.</li>
<li>7-8 Your bloodline has long been associated with minor and obscure aspects of service, and your family seldom even visits the Imperial Court. You may not purchase Social Advantages at character creation.</li>
<li>9-0 Your ancestor failed in his duty to the ruling Dynasty, and the shame of that failure remains with your bloodline. Gain the Black Sheep Disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Table 2: Imperial Families Illustrious Past</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll Result</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 Your line is known for its piety and all of your ancestors have made regular visits to the Four Temples. You start play with a free 4-point Ally in the Four Temples Order of the Brotherhood of Shinsei.</li>
<li>3-4 Your ancestor did a great favor for a clan samurai, and his line remains beholden to you. Any Ally you take from that clan gains +1 Devotion.</li>
<li>5-6 Your ancestors protected the Dynasty in one of the great battles of the Empire’s history - perhaps they fought alongside Hantei Fujiwa against the Shadowlands, or joined one of the Imperial Legions during crises such as the return of Iuchiban or the Destroyer War. You gain +1.0 Glory and +1 rank in the Battle Skill.</li>
<li>7-8 Your ancestor was a loyal and skilled miharu who protected the Emperor from an assassination attempt. You gain +1.0 Glory and +1 rank in the Defense Skill.</li>
<li>9-0 Your ancestors used their connections and Imperial power to gain wealth and influence. You gain the Gentry Advantage and you may purchase the Ally Advantage for one less Experience Point.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Table 3: Imperial Families Mixed Blessings</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll Result</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Your ancestors were among the miharu who overthrew the tyrant Hantei XVI and then committed seppuku to atone for their betrayal of duty. You gain +1.0 Honor, but also start play with the Infamy Disadvantage.</li>
<li>2-3 Your ancestors have been part of the Imperial Bureaucracy for generations, and while this duty is obscure it grants you many useful connections. You start play with 0.5 Glory and 0.5 Status, but may purchase the Ally Advantage for 1 less Experience Point.</li>
<li>4-5 Your ancestors were involved with the Gozoku conspiracy, but managed to save themselves by switching sides at the right time. You gain the Crafty Advantage but also start with one less Rank of Honor.</li>
<li>6-7 Your ancestors helped organize the Imperial system of laws and magistrates during the reign of Hantei Genji, and in the process disrupted the improper activities of other samurai. You gain +1 Rank in the Lore: Law Skill, but also gain a 3-point Sworn Enemy in a clan/family/faction of your choice.</li>
<li>8-9 Your ancestor was both influential and highly religious, and became deeply involved in a theological dispute which obsessed the Empire at the time. Some within the Brotherhood of Shinsei considered his behavior to be arrogant and improper. You gain +1 Rank of Lore: Theology, but also gain the Cast Out Disadvantage for one major sect in the Brotherhood.</li>
<li>0 Your ancestor was known for his great wealth but also for his infamous self-indulgence and luxurious lifestyle. You gain four Ranks in the Wealthy Advantage, but also gain either the Compulsion Disadvantage or the Lechery Disadvantage (your choice).</li>

                <h4 class="display-4">Minor Shadowlands Powers</h4>
                <hr />
                <h5 id="above-the-elements">Above the Elements</h5>
<p>The power of Jigoku renders you resistant to normal (non-maho) magic. All normal elemental spells that could affect you suffer a +10 TN penally to their Spell Casting Rolls. However, you are more vulnerable to the power of the kansen. and any maho spell that targets you gains a Free Raise. Any shugenja who casts Sense within range of you will notice a distinct absence of kami around you.</p>
<h5 id="blackened-claws">Blackened Claws</h5>
<p>You have claws of obsidian. concealed within your fingertips, which you can extend as a free Action. The claws grant you a DR of 2k3 with unarmed attacks (in place of the normal Ok1) and are considered obsidian for the purpose of bypassing Reduction and Invulnerability. However. you feel the urge to use these claws every time you fight - you must make a Willpower Roll at TN 10 any time you start a fight with a weapon other than the claws.</p>
<h5 id="blessing-of-the-dark-one">Blessing of The Dark One</h5>
<p>You have an unnatural resistance to pain and physical harm. Your Wounds at each Wound Rank are increased by 3.</p>
<h5 id="blood-knows-blood">Blood Knows Blood</h5>
<p>You may continually sense the location of any portion of your blood or flesh (any-thing but hair and fingernails), no matter where they may be. If you also possess the Blood Domination power. you can track the location of any creature that has consumed your blood.</p>
<h5 id="calligraphy-of-thought">Calligraphy of Thought</h5>
<p>You can read the surface thoughts of anyone within your line of sight. This is a Free Action and requires you to win a Contested Air Roll. With a success, you sense whatever the target is thinking about at that moment. This power cannot root out deeper emotions or subconscious knowledge.</p>
<h5 id="child-of-darkness">Child of Darkness</h5>
<p>The power of the Taint protects you from other servants of Jigoku. Shadowlands creatures will not attack unless you threaten them. If you can communicate with them, they might obey your commands. especially if you seem powerful or persuasive.</p>
<h5 id="eyes-of-hell">Eyes of Hell</h5>
<p>The power of the Taint allows you to see with an unnatural clarity under any circumstances. You may choose to see through darkness, shadows, fog, smoke, or any similar visual impairment. However, whenever you use this power your eyes glow with an unnatural light (usually green or blue), betraying your presence and nature.</p>
<h5 id="fear">Fear</h5>
<p>The power of the Taint allows you to unleash a wave of inhuman terror, freezing the blood of your enemies. Once per skirmish you can project an aura of fear, inflicting a Fear 5 effect on all your enemies within sight.</p>
<h5 id="jade-sense">Jade Sense</h5>
<p>You have an Innate sense for the presence of sacred substances such as jade. You can detect the presence of all jade, crystal, and obsidian near you, out to a maximum distance equal to Earth x 10 in feet. Concealing magic can obstruct this sense. You cannot detect Jade Petal Tea.</p>
<h5 id="master-of-blood">Master of Blood</h5>
<p>The kansen are your friends, and you have an Innate talent for casting maho spells. You may cast maho for one less Wound than normally required, and the amount of Taint you gain from casting maho spells is reduced by your Earth (to a minimum of 1 point of Taint). All non-maho spells you cast. however, are at a +10 TN penalty.</p>
<h5 id="master-of-shadows">Master of Shadows</h5>
<p>You have an unnatural affinity for darkness and shadows. You may add your Taint Rank in unkept dice to all Stealth Skill rolls you make. You gain the Discolored Skin mutation if you do not already have it, as your skin develops a dark and shadowy tone.</p>
<h5 id="mind-of-darkness">Mind of Darkness</h5>
<p>You may embrace the Taint to enhance your rolls with mental Traits (Intelligence, Willpower. Awareness. and Perception) in the same manner as you would normally enhance rolls with physical Traits. If you become Lost. you may add your Taint Rank to the total of all rolls made with mental Traits as well as all rolls with physical Traits.</p>
<h5 id="monstrous-strength">Monstrous Strength</h5>
<p>The Taint suffuses your muscles, giving you a swollen, unnatural build that unsettles those who meet you. You suffer - 1k0 to all Social rolls. In return, you add your Taint Rank in unkept dice to all Strength rolls, Strength-based Skill rolls, and Damage rolls you make.</p>
<h5 id="sense-purity">Sense Purity</h5>
<p>The absence of Taint calls to you, setting your teeth on edge with the knowledge of purity and honor. As a Free Action you can sense the presence of non-Tainted humans within fifty feet by winning a Contested Awareness Roll. (This naturally makes you extremely difficult to surprise.) You can sense them at greater distances, up to a half mile, but this requires a Complex Action and they receive two Free Raises on their Awareness roll.</p>
<h5 id="uncanny-speed">Uncanny Speed</h5>
<p>The Taint grants you speed greater than should be possible for someone of your size and strength. Your Water Ring is considered to be two Ranks higher for the purpose of how far you can move with a Simple or Complex Move Action. In return, you are fidgety and nervous. unable to sit still for more than a few minutes.</p>
<h5 id="unholy-stamina">Unholy Stamina</h5>
<p>You may go without rest or sleep for up to three days with no penalties of any kind. This power must be reactivated after three days, requiring another roll to resist gaining Taint.</p>

                <h4 class="display-4">Mutations</h4>
                <hr />
                <h5 id="albinism">Albinism</h5>
<p>Your skin and hair become deathly pale, perhaps even stark white. This is very unsettling in appearance. but can be concealed with cosmetics. You suffer a -1k0 penalty to social rolls if your true appearance is known.</p>
<h5 id="beast-of-fu-leng">Beast of Fu Leng</h5>
<p>The most terrible of mutations, this causes you to completely lose human form, distorting into a bestial or monstrous body - typically a quadruped or a bloated, ogre-ish humanoid. This severe deformity cannot be hidden, and causes a Fear 1 effect in anyone who sees it.</p>
<h5 id="chitinous-armor">Chitinous Armor</h5>
<p>Your skin has hardened into an insect-like shell that protects you physically but also exposes your inhuman nature. This grants you Reduction of 10 (which stacks with any Reduction you gain from armor, spells, or other effects).</p>
<h5 id="demonic-eyes">Demonic Eyes</h5>
<p>Any time you are in darkness or shadow, your eyes glow with an unnatural blue light. This allows you to see through darkness or other visual impairment 'such as smoke or fog).</p>
<h5 id="discolored-skin">Discolored Skin</h5>
<p>Your skin turns an unnaturally pale or dark shade. This can be explained away as the result of an indoor or outdoor life, but regardless, it inflicts a +5Â TN penalty to all Social rolls.</p>
<h5 id="distorted-limbs">Distorted Limbs</h5>
<p>One of your arms or legs, randomly chosen, becomes misshapen or twisted, rendering it useless. This is an obvious deformity that is extremely difficult to conceal. although it can probably be explained away as the result of an injury. If the deformed limb is a leg. you gain the Lame disadvantage. If It is on arm, you suffer a -3k0 penalty to any rolls made with that arm.</p>
<h5 id="extra-digit">Extra Digit</h5>
<p>You sprout an additional finger or toe. This is an obvious but minor deformity. It does not automatically suggest the presence of Taint. but it does make those who notice it uneasy, causing you to suffer a -1k0 penalty to all social skill rolls. If the digit is cut off, it will regrow within 48 hours.</p>
<h5 id="extra-eye">Extra Eye</h5>
<p>An additional eye sprouts somewhere on your body. This grants you +1kO to Perception rolls and Perception-based Skill rolls, but the eye must be uncovered (and thus possibly noticeable to others) to gain this benefit.</p>
<h5 id="extra-limb">Extra Limb</h5>
<p>Your character sprouts an additional arm or leg. This limb is obviously Tainted, with discolored skin, claw-like nails, etc. It Is 50% likely to be non-functional, hanging limp from the body, In which case the resulting obstruction and clumsiness causes you to suffer a -1k0 to all Agility-based and Reflexes-based rolls.</p>
<h5 id="forked-tongue">Forked Tongue</h5>
<p>Your tongue becomes long and forked, like a snake's tongue. Concealing this mutation while speaking or eating requires a roll of Acting 1 Awareness at TN 20.</p>
<h5 id="foul-odor">Foul Odor</h5>
<p>You manifest an exceptionally putrid and disgusting body odor. Impossible to ignore. No amount of bathing or perfume can suppress it. You suffer a - 1k0 penalty to all Social rolls.</p>
<h5 id="jigokus-blood">Jigoku's Blood</h5>
<p>Your blood becomes black and foul-smelling. Anyone who sees you injured will recognize this as an obvious symptom of the taint.</p>
<h5 id="tentacles">Tentacles</h5>
<p>You sprout one or more tentacles, which you are able to partially control. You can use them to pick up small objects, to make attacks with Small weapons. or to initiate a Grapple. Anyone seeing these tentacles will immediately recognize you as Tainted.</p>
<h5 id="tough-hide">Tough Hide</h5>
<p>Your skin becomes rough and leathery. This causes you to appear unnatural or diseased, inflicting a -2k0 penalty to all Social rolls However. your unnatural skin does provide some resistance to harm. granting you Reduction 5.</p>
<h5 id="undead-visage">Undead Visage</h5>
<p>You gain the outward appearance of being undead. with deathly gray skin, visible skin decay. and deeply sunken eyes. This deformity cannot be concealed. and causes a fear 3 effect on anyone who sees it.</p>
<h5 id="vile-teeth">Vile Teeth</h5>
<p>Your teeth become distorted and/or discolored, to the point of appearing inhuman. They might become palmed or jagged, sprout animal-like fangs. turn a deep brown or sickly yellow color. etc. Concealing your grotesque teeth while talking or eating Is difficult, requiring a roll of Acting / Awareness at TN 20.</p>
<h5 id="wings">Wings</h5>
<p>Your body has sprouted large wings that allow you to fly for short distances. These wings may be birdlike (feathered), leathery, or reptilian in nature. They can be folded up and with some difficulty can be concealed beneath a cloak or haori (with a roll of Acting / Awareness at TN 25). Folding or unfolding the wings is a Simple Action. When unfolded, the wings allow you to fly, with your Move Actions calculated at Water +2.</p>

<h2 id="toc2"><span>Table 3: Phoenix Mixed Blessings</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll result</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Your ancestor was a shugenja of some renown with her Element, but was absolutely terrible with the opposing Element. You may take the Friend of the Elements (Element of your choice) Advantage for 1 less Experience Point, but also gain Wrath of the Kami in the opposing Element.</li>
<li>2-3 A kansen tempted your ancestor into using maho, leaving a stain on your family name. The kansen has since found you. It acts as the Friendly Kami advantage, but the bonuses only apply to casting Maho spells.</li>
<li>4-5 One of your ancestors went missing for several months. No one is sure where he went, but when he returned he had no memories save for a message he claimed was from the Celestial Heavens. You may take the Advantage Chosen by the Oracles for 2 less Experience Points, but you also gain the Disadvantage Lord Moon’s Curse.</li>
<li>6-7 Your ancestor was repeatedly defeated at something, and your family has made a point of being the best at it ever since. Choose a Skill. You gain the Jealousy Disadvantage in that Skill, but you also gain either 2 free Ranks in that Skill or one free Emphasis in that Skill.</li>

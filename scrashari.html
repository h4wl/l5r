<h3 id="toc1"><span>Ra'Shari Knife-Fighter (Warrior)</span></h3>
<p>Despite the best efforts of the more diplomatic members of the Great Caravan, the Ra'Shari are not welcome everywhere they go. It became clear early in their wanderings that the Ra'Shari would need to be able to protect themselves. A brilliant nomad named Stevo discovered that the same economy of motion practiced by dancing could be employed by agile warriors seeking to avoid their opponent's weapons.</p>

<h3 id="toc2"><span>Ra'Shari Trader (Diplomat)</span></h3>
<p>Commerce is life to the Ra'Shari, since their nomadic lifestyle makes trading a good way to make money in the burning sands. The Great Caravan of Commerce has mastered the art of the traveling salesman, bringing to people what they need and what they want. While the techniques of the Ra'Shari Trader existed long before the splitting of the Great Caravans, they have been perfected since.</p>

If you know a target’s material desires you can make a Contested Commerce/Awareness Roll against their Etiquette/Willpower to convince them that you can satisfy their material wants at a reasonable price and promise to deliver those goods at a specified time. If you do so you may gain them as an Ally at no cost until the promised goods arrive at the specified time (assuming the goods arrive at all). The GM is the arbiter of what constitutes a reasonable delivery time. Misuse of this technique has given the Rashari the reputation that they have today, wise traders would do well to leave friends behind rather than disappointed enemies.</p>
<h3 id="toc3"><span>Ra'Shari Diviner (Sahir)</span></h3>
<p>A long time ago, the Ra'Shari were the chosen people of Vishnu, and called upon the tripartite blessings of Provider, Preserver and Pervader. Today however this connection is long gone. Ra'Shari magic still comes in three parts, but their new aspects reflect their long duty in the Burning Sands.</p>

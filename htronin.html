</ul>
<h2 id="toc0"><span>Table 1: Ronin Shameful Past</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll Result</p>
<ul>
<li>1 You started your life as a criminal and your deeds haunt you today. You gain the Infamy Disadvantage and have a magistrate and/or a bounty hunter as a 3-point Sworn Enemy.</li>
<li>2-3 You grew up with no permanent home and have no connections to any location. You may not take the Way of the Land, Hero of the People, or Ally Advantages.</li>
<li>4-5 Your difficult life up until now has left you with an unfortunate addictive habit. You gain a 3-point Compulsion (alcohol, opium, gambling, etc).</li>
<li>6-7 You or your parents antagonized a clan samurai, and although you managed to escape the consequences at the time, he has not forgotten you. Gain a clan samurai as a 4-point Sworn Enemy.</li>
<li>8-9 Your difficult life has given you a hot temper, and you find it hard to restrain yourself even when you know you should. You gain the Brash Disadvantage for no points.</li>
<li>0 Your family has rejected Bushido in favor of a more selfish path. You gain the Consumed Disadvantage for no points.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Table 2: Ronin Illustrious Past</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll Result</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Your family maintains connections to a ronin band or religious order in another part of the Empire. You may learn a higher-Rank ronin Technique of your choice once you attain the appropriate Insight Rank.</li>
<li>2-3 You have benefited from extra training, either due to your familyâ€™s personal traditions or a connection to an ally. You gain +1 Rank in one Weapon Skill of your choice.</li>
<li>4-5 Your family has carefully maintained the patronage of a Great Clan samurai family. You gain a 3-point Ally Advantage in a Great Clan family of your choice.</li>
<li>6-7 You are a popular and successful member in a ronin band, allowing you to benefit from both better training and from the friendship and protection of your fellow wave-men. In addition to the normal effects of starting as a member of a ronin band, you also gain the Ally Advantage with two ronin NPCs (2 points each) who are in your band.</li>
<li>8-9 You are known as a compassionate ronin who helps the common people. Whether or not this reputation is actually deserved, you gain the Hero of the People Advantage.</li>
<li>0 Your family is descended from a Great Clan samurai and has carefully preserved the weapon he once carried. You may purchase the Sacred Weapon Advantage for your ancestorâ€™s Great Clan.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Table 3: Ronin Mixed Blessings</span></h2>
<p>D10 Roll Result</p>
<ul>
<li>1 You or your parents grew up in a Brotherhood temple which took in orphans, and this religious legacy impacts you in many ways. You may take the Friend of the Elements Advantage for free (or the Friend of the Brotherhood Advantage if you are a shugenja), but also gain the Ascetic Disadvantage.</li>
<li>2-3 One of your parents won a notable duel against a clan samurai - and that samuraiâ€™s family has not forgotten. You gain +1 Rank in the Iaijutsu Skill, but also gain a 3-point Sworn Enemy from that clan.</li>
<li>4-5 You belong or were previously associated with a ronin band which was unusually successful and wealthy. Unfortunately, this was because it engaged in criminal activity. You add 5 koku and one weapon of your choice to your starting Outfit, but also gain the Disadvantage of Dark Secret: Criminal</li>
<li>6-7 You have had - or perhaps are still conducting - a secret love affair with a Great Clan samurai. As a result, you may take both the Kharmic Tie Advantage and the Ally Advantage with that samurai, but also gain either the True Love or the Lost Love Disadvantage (as appropriate) in relation to that same samurai.</li>
<li>8-9 Either you or your parents were born as clan samurai but became ronin due to the manipulations of a rival. You retain many connections within your former clan, including friends who would gladly help you avenge yourself. You have a 5-point Sworn Enemy within your former clan but also may purchase up to three Allies (each of a maximum of 3 points) within that clan.</li>
<li>0 For whatever reason, your family has often flirted with the powers of darkness. You gain the Advantage of Forbidden Knowledge: Maho, but also gain 1 Rank in the Shadowlands Taint.</li>

                <div >
                    <p class="lead">
Rokugan is a land of diverse geography, ranging from open
plains and fertile farmlands to rugged mountains and tropical
islands. For the most part, the climate is temperate, with a
long and fairly warm summer but a surprisingly bitter winter
&mdash; all of continental Rokugan experiences significant snowfall
during the winter months, and travel slows to a crawl during
that time.
</p>
<h2 id="notable-features">Notable Features</h2>
<p>The most notable geographic features of Rokugan are its
two great mountain ranges, known as the Great Wall of the
North and the Spine of the World (or Seikitsu) Mountains.
The Great Wall of the North defines Rokugan's northern frontier,
and serves as a barrier between the lands of the Phoenix, Dragon, and Unicorn Glans and the open steppes which lie beyond,
inhabited by gaijin barbarians. The Spine of the
World range divides Rokugan in half, running across the Empire from the northwest to the southeast. Although there are
several passes near the ends of this mountain chain, in its
vast center it is crossed by only one major pass. For much of
the Empire's history this was the fabled Beiden Pass, which
connected the lands of the Lion and Scorpion, but during the
War of Spirits this pass was destroyed. Through the will of
the GCelestial Heavens, a new pass was opened farther to the
north, the Seikitsu Pass, connecting the lands of the Scorpion
and Unicorn.</p>
<h2 id="the-burning-sands-shinomen-forest">The Burning Sands &amp; Shinomen Forest</h2>
<p>Beyond the borders of Rokugan to the west and north-
west lies the vast desert of the Burning Sands. Strange foreign lands and kingdoms may be found on the far side of the
Burning Sands, and Rokugan has occasionally made contact
with them, but for the most part the Empire ignores this bleak
desert and whatever lies beyond. On the western border of
Rokugan, forming a natural barrier between the Empire and
the Burning Sands, lies the Shinomen Forest, a vast primeval
forest which is home to ghosts and strange inhuman creatures, most notably the legendary Naga. Rokugani avoid this place, and few know of what lies within.</p>
<h2 id="the-shadowlands">The Shadowlands</h2>
<p>To the southwest, however, lies a realm whose attentions
Rokugan cannot escape, however much the Empire might
wish it: the Shadowlands, the corrupt and terrifying domain
created when Fu Leng fell from the Celestial Heavens at the
lawn of time. Fu Leng's terrible fall tore a hole through reality into Jigoku, the Realm of Evil, creating the fabled Festering Pit of Fu Leng. Oni, other monsters, and the horrible Taint continually emerge from the Festering Pit, and their influence has created the Shadowlands.</p>
<h2 id="crab-lands">Crab Lands</h2>
<p>The Crab lands serve as the border between the Shadowlands
and the rest of Rokugan. Here the Grab stand eternally
vigilant behind the barrier of the Kaiu Wall, the mightiest
fortification in the Empire. The Grab lands tend to be rocky and
mountainous, with little agricultural productivity. Even worse,
over the centuries some of their territory has been Tainted by
Shadowlands incursions. While the Taint was purged from
those lands, what remains behind is little more than lifeless
wastes. The waters of Earthquake Fish Bay provide the Crab
with abundant seafood, but even with that resource they are
chronically short on food, forced to import from the rest of
the Empire. However, their rocky lands do contain abundant
ore and mineral wealth, especially iron.</p>
<h2 id="crane-lands">Crane Lands</h2>
<p>In contrast to the Crab, the Crane lands are some of the
broadest and most productive in Rokugan. The Crane control
territories both north and south of the Seikitsu Mountains.
and boast great fields of rice and grain in both regions. They
control almost the entire coast of the Empire from the border
of Crab lands all the way north to the ancient capital of Otosan Uchi,
and those coasts are dotted with large, prosperous
port cities, their bays filled with shipping throughout the year.
Small wonder, then, that the Crane can boast of being among
the wealthiest of clans, with castles whose size and beauty are
exceeded only by the Imperial Capital itself.</p>
<h2 id="scorpion-lands">Scorpion Lands</h2>
<p>The Scorpion lands, north of the Crab and surrounded to
the east and north by the Seikitsu Mountains, are moderately
populated, with several forests and rivers, notably the mighty
River of Gold, a major trade artery in the western Empire.
The Scorpion do, however. lay claim to one of the largest cit-
ies in Rokugan, the great trade center of Ryoko Owari. Inns
and teahouses in Scorpion lands are reputed to be among the
Empire's finest, perhaps because the Scorpion wish for their
visitors to always be relaxed and comfortable.</p>
<h2 id="unicorn-lands">Unicorn Lands</h2>
<p>In the northeast of Rokugan, adjacent to the Burning
Sands, lie the rolling hills and open plains of the Unicorn
Clan, crossed by several lesser rivers and dotted with the
Occasional small forest. The Unicorn have few cities, since most
of their folk maintain the nomadic traditions formed by centuries
wandering outside of the Empire. They do, however,
have many small farming villages, as well as a handful of
diamond mines that enrich their merchants.</p>
<h2 id="lion-lands">Lion Lands</h2>
<p>The Lion Clan, traditional rivals of the Crane, control the
north-central plains of the Empire, a wide and fertile territory
but one which is stressed by the need to support the vast
armies of this martial clan. Forests are sparse in this territory,
and the Lion carefully control them to prevent exhaustion of
their limited timber resources. The Lion also have a number of
copper mines on their side of the Seikitsu Mountains, a useful
source of trade for a clan routinely short of rice. Packs of wild
links, the namesakes of the Lion Clan, may be found in these
lands with some frequency, although they are rare elsewhere
in Rokugan.</p>
<h2 id="dragon-lands">Dragon Lands</h2>
<p>The Dragon lands, separated from the Lion by the Drowned
Merchant River, are for the most part quite mountainous, with
high peaks surrounded by thick forests. The Dragon lands are
directly adjacent to the Great Wall of the North, and are
notoriously difficult for others to enter without permission.
Many tales speak of roads that mysteriously vanish or seem to turn
back on themselves. The price of such security, however, is
a distinct lack of productive farmland, and the Dragon are
almost certainly the poorest Great Clan in the Empire.</p>
<h2 id="phoenix-lands">Phoenix Lands</h2>
<p>The Phoenix lands are tucked into the Empire's northeastern
corner, with two small mountain ranges separating them
from the rest of Rokugan. The Phoenix Mountains form a
barrier to the west, toward the Dragon lands, while the
Mountains of Regret lie to the south, toward Otosan Uchi. Between
the two ranges is a relatively narrow plain through which
passes most of the Phoenix Clan's trade and commerce with
the rest of Rokugan. Their territory also boasts a major forest,
the Isawa Mori, reputed to be haunted by ghosts and angry
spirits. Most of their farmlands and major castles are located
along the coast, but the Phoenix have few actual ports, since
much of their coastline is rugged cliffs.</p>
<h2 id="mantis-lands">Mantis Lands</h2>
<p>South of the Empire's mainland lie the Islands of Silk and
Spice, where the Mantis Clan makes its home. In contrast to
the rest of the Empire, these islands are tropical, covered in
lush vegetation and strange animals unknown to the mainland.
Colorful birds, monkeys, constrictor snakes, and other
exotic and dangerous forms of life are common. The Mantis
have relatively little farmland, and rely primarily on the
abundance of the sea to feed themselves.</p>

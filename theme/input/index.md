Title: Legend of the Five Rings
---

The Rokugani believe that all of reality is organized
into five Elements&mdash;Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Void&mdash;and
it is from these that the "five rings" of the title are derived.
Accordingly, this site is divided into five sections, each discussing 
a different aspect of Legend of the Five Rings.

###### [The Book of Air](/book-of-air) 
The Book of Air contains basic information on the world of
Rokugan. It includes a brief century-by-century history of the
Emerald Empire, a discussion of Rokugani culture, beliefs, and
customs, and specific discussion of the eight Great Clans who
dominate the Empire's history and conflicts.

###### [The Book of Earth](/book-of-earth) 
The Book of Earth contains the basic rules of the game.
It explains the fundamental mechanics of playing Legend of
the Five Rings, including the role and importance of the five
Elemental Rings, the various die-rolling mechanics, and the
essential rules of combat, dueling, and other actions.

###### [The Book of Fire](/book-of-fire) 
The Book of Fire contains the basic character creation rules
and offers detailed discussions of how to make an assortment
of basic character types from each of the eight Great Clans. It
also offers a full list of Skills, Advantages, Disadvantages, and
Spells for use in the game.

###### [The Book of Water](/book-of-water) 
The Book of Water contains advanced and optional rules,
rules which the GM and players can decide to use or ignore as
they please. These rules add more variety and customization
options to the game. They include information on playing a
character from one of the Minor Clans or Imperial Families,
and a variety of special mechanics such as Alternate Paths,
Advanced Schools, Kata, Kiho, Ancestors, and the sinister se-
crets of black magic (also known as maho) and the Shadowlands Taint.

###### [The Book of Void](/book-of-the-void) 
Finally, the Book of Void contains rules and information for
the GM. There is an extended discussion of different ways to
construct adventures and campaigns for L5R, as well as rules
for monsters and natural creatures, a basic selection of such
creatures with which to challenge the players, and a sample
adventure with which to start out your Legend of the Five
Rings gaming experience.

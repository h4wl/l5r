The Rokugani believe that all of reality is organized
into five Elements&mdash;Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Void&mdash;and
it is from these that the "five rings" of the title are derived.
Accordingly, this site is divided into five sections, each discussing 
a different aspect of Legend of the Five Rings.

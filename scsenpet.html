<h3 id="toc1"><span>Senpet Legionnaire (Warrior)</span></h3>
<p>Before the Yodotai invasion, the Senpet Empire boasted of a highly and trained loyal army that numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

<h3 id="toc2"><span>Senpet Charioteer (Warrior)</span></h3>
<p>The Senpet military has many advantages over its opponents that are nearly unique to this nation. Among them is the chariot, a marvelous technology that is feared by all enemies who must march against it. It is a two-wheeled cart that is drawn by one or two horses. Those who fight on a chariot are often skilled spearmen or archers.</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="toc5"><span>Avatar of the Ten Thousand (Warrior)</span></h3>
<p>The Avatar of Ten Thousan dis part of a special unit inside the Senpet armies. He is not subject to the command of the senpet generals. Instead, they are a unit of the Senpet priesthood and follow the isntruction of the gods into battle. They are blessed by divine strength and divine fortune as they fight for the Ten Thousand. Soldiers that fight alongside the Avatars are cheered, knowing the gods truly stand with them.</p>
<h6 id="requirements">Requirements:</h6>

<h2 id="toc6"><span>Alternate Paths</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc7"><span>Ghul Destroyer</span></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replaces:</strong> Senpet Sahir 3</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> None</li>
<li><strong>Technique:</strong> <em>Holy Devastation</em> - Whenever you cast a spell that damages, impedes or destroys an undead creature, you gain a number of Free Raises equal to your School Rank.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc8"><span>Ghul Destroyer</span></h3>
<p>The Senpet religion strikes everyone who does not know it intimately as bloody and cruel. Those who practice the worship of the Ten Thousand Gods do not disagree: they simply know it is necessary to maintain the strength of the Empire. One of the unfortunate side effects of those religious ceremonies is that they occasionately release undead monsters into the world. Over the course of the years the Senpet have created and refined the techniques used to destroy those creatures quickly and efficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replaces:</strong> Any Senpet Warrior 3</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> None</li>
<li><strong>Technique:</strong> <em>Holy Strike</em> - You gain a +3k1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls against undead creatures. Additionally, you gain a Free Raise to any Hunting Skill Rolls made for the purpose of finding the undead.</li>

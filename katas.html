                <p>Kata are fighting postures and movements that have evolved over the centuries, and are reinforced through constant repetition during training. Individual kata styles mesh well with particular Schools, and while individual clans develop some kata as a means of diversifying the Techniques of their ancestral Schools, most are developed independently by talented samurai and taught to others without concern for family or clan. For example, the Nightingale Style was developed by a sub-group within the Mirumoto family and carefully protected from outsiders, and eventually evolved into a Technique centuries later. By comparison, the Wind in Darkened Skies Style is an athletic attack style known to virtually every clan, whose creator has been long since forgotten over the years.</p>
<p>Kata are a means to differentiate between bushi characters without mechanics that are as signifi cant as Techniques, but more specific and martial than Skills or Advantages. A bushi character can purchase a Kata if the character’s School is listed as one of those that can utilize the Kata, and if the character’s relevant Ring is equal to or higher than the listed Mastery Level. Purchasing a Kata costs a number of Experience Points equal to its Mastery Level. For example, the Breath of Wind Style Kata is available only to students of the Bayushi Bushi School and the Kakita Bushi School, who may purchase it for 3 Experience Points if they have an Air Ring of 3 or higher (because the Kata’s Mastery Level is Air 3).</p>
<p>Once a character is familiar with a Kata, he can execute it at any time. Executing a Kata is a Simple Action. Once a character has executed a Kata, he gains the listed benefit of the Kata until the effect expires (if a duration is listed) or he chooses to drop out of it (which is a Free Action). A character may only have one Kata active at a given time.</p>

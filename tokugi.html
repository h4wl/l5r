        <p>Tokugi are special techniques that can only be used by bushi. They function as highly specialized combat manoeuvers (such as Feint and Disarm) and represent the ultimate result of years of training. Unlike Kata, they are not stances but specific gestures, whose power rivalizes with the intricate design of Kihos. Performing a Tokugi is similar to performing a standard attack manoeuver (as a Complex Action), and can be activated either by Raising a number of times equal to the Tokugi’s Mastery Level, or by spending a Void Point.</p>
<p>It is possible to combine two or more Tokugi in a single strike, although doing so means taking great risks : one must make a number of Raises equal to the total number of Raises needed to perform all declared Tokugi separately. Furthermore, spending a Void Point on such a roll only negates the required Raises for a single Tokugi.</p>
<p>Purchasing Tokugi costs a number of Experience Points equal to the Tokugi’s Mastery Level. A bushi may only learn a Tokugi if their relevant Ring is equal to or higher than the listed Mastery Level. Additionally, a Tokugi may only be used with specific weapon types, and often needs a minimal number of skill ranks with said weapons to be performed.</p>
<p>A Bushi may not know more than one Tokugi per level. However, <a href="/l5r/kenshi-schools">Kenshi Schools</a> are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Only Tokugi with the Iaijutsu Skill may be used as part of the Strike phase of a Iaijutsu dueling, and only if the minimal number of Iaijutsu skill ranks is achieved. Tokugi used this way need to be declared during the Assessment part of the duel.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 3</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Iaijutsu 3, Jiujutsu 3, Kenjutsu 3, Polearms 3, Staves 3</li>
<li>Effect: Perceiving the flow of battle is an essential part of Water Tokujutsu. When this Tokugi is activated, until the next Reaction Stage, you cannot be surprised, negate all penalties from being ambushed, and ignore all effects meant to deceive you, including enemy Feints and illusions.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="flowing-blood-cut">Flowing Blood Cut</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Kenjutsu 5, Knives 5, Ninjutsu 5</li>
<li>Effect: Deemed unclean by most Tokujutsu practicioners, this technique forces blood to exit a wounded person's body, weakening them until their swift death. When you perform this Tokugi, the opponent takes damage each turn equal to your Water Ring, until all wounds dealt by this Tokugi are healed. Multiple applications of this technique do not stack.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Jiujutsu 5, Kenjutsu 5, Staves 5</li>
<li>Effect: A blade of keen water can cast aside even powerful spells. If you didn't act this turn, when you are targeted by a spell, you may use this Tokugi. If the result of the Attack Roll is higher than the opponent's Spellcasting Roll - regardless of whether you can actually hit the spell's user - the spell is immediately negated. You lose a Complex Action (or Simple Action, if you can attack as Simple Actions) immediately afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Water 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Any 5</li>

<li>Weapon Types: Chain Weapons 7, Heavy Weapons 7, Kenjutsu 7, Knives 7, Jiujutsu 7, Staves 7</li>
<li>Effect: This sinister, forbidden technique resembles the cursed arts of the Maho-tsukai, and may in fact be inspired from the Dark Moto's endless hunger. When you perform this Tokugi, you add +2k0 to your Damage Rolls, and you immediately regain Wounds equal to half the number of Wounds inflicted by this Tokugi on your opponent, rounded down. If you kill the opponent, double the amount of recovered Wounds.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h6 id="thoughtless-draw">Thoughtless Draw</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 3</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Iaijutsu 3</li>

<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 3</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Jiujutsu 3, Kenjutsu 3, Knives 3, Staves 3</li>
<li>Effect: The Void always strikes true, regardless of obstacles and impediments. Your attack with this Tokugi automatically ignores all penalties from concealment, weather conditions, Disadvantages or conditions such as Blindness, and magical or nonmagical obstruction. This does not allow the attack to penetrate Invulnerability, ignore Reduction, or ignore the target's Armor.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="guided-by-the-empty">Guided by the Empty</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 3</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Any 3</li>

<h6 id="kharmic-retribution">Kharmic Retribution</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Kenjutsu 5, Spears 5, Staves 5</li>
<li>Effect: This Tokugi allows its user to transcend the laws of the universe, by striking down an opponent before they could make their own attack. If you didn't act this turn, when you are targeted by a melee attack, you may use this Tokugi. If you are successful, you attack the opponent before their own strike resolves. You lose a Complex Action (or Simple Action, if you can attack as Simple Actions) immediately afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="ten-realms-slice">Ten Realms Slice</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Jiujutsu 5, Kenjutsu 5, Knives 3, Kyujutsu 5, Polearms 5, Staves 5</li>
<li>Effect: A blade imbued with the Void can slice through everything, even Kharma. When you strike your opponent with the Tokugi, they immediately gain a rank in the Unlucky Disadvantage for the rest of the day.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="deny-the-breath">Deny the Breath</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Iaijutsu 5, Jiujutsu 5, Kenjutsu 5</li>
<li>Effect: This Tokugi prevents others from calling upon their own skills.

</ul>
<h6 id="strike-of-all-and-none">Strike of All and None</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Iaijutsu 5, Kenjutsu 5, Knives 5, Ninjutsu 5</li>
<li>Effect: A talented enough Void Tokujutsu master is able to follow Mirumoto's teachings and strike even when it seems impossible. You may perform this Tokugi in situations where you cannot attack your target - because you are restrained, unable to move, your target is protected, or any other reason. You must be able to make eye contact with your target in order to declare this Tokugi. As a Complex Action, you attack the opponent despite it being impossible, as the Void transmits your killing intent.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="one-with-the-reaper">One with the Reaper</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 5</li>
<li>Weapon Types: Chain Weapons 7, Jiujutsu 7, Kenjutsu 7</li>
<li>Effect: Perhaps the most complex and dangerous Tokugi, it allows one to reach a dark moment of enlightenment, then steal the opponent's breath in a single strike. If this strike successfully hits an individual, they must immediately spend a Void Point or make a Void Ring Roll with a TN equal to your Attack Roll. In case of failure, the enemy is immediately killed - or reduced to the Out Wound Rank, at the GM's discretion.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="the-silence-is-mine">The Silence is Mine</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery: Void 5</li>

<li>Weapon Types : Knives 5, Ninjutsu 5, Polearms 5, Staves 5</li>
<li>Effect: Air's illusory speed and Water's dark clarity allow to rob the opponent of their sense of sight, attacking them when they are defenseless. If this Tokugi successfully hits your opponent, they are considered to be Blinded for a number of Rounds equal to your Water Ring, for the purpose of attacking you and evading your attacks, and you add your Air Ring to all Damage Rolls against him during that effect.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="storm-gods-speed">Storm God's Speed</h6>

For each such effect dispelled, add +1k0 to your Damage Roll.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="obsidian-moon-fall">Obsidian Moon Fall</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery : Earth 4 and Fire 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types : Heavy Weapons 5, Staves 5, Polearms 5</li>
<li>Effect: This forbidden technique calls upon the shadowed Earth and hellish Fire to overwhelm the enemy with a breaking blow, similar to a meteor fall. This technique strikes all enemies in front of the user. The opponents' armors, if any, immediately gain the Broken condition. The targets' Wound Penalties are increased by two steps for a number of rounds equal to your Earth Ring, and you add +Xk0 to the Damage Roll, where X is your Fire Ring.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="flower-kamis-roar">Flower Kami's Roar</h6>
<ul>
<li>Ring/Mastery : Earth 4 and Water 4</li>
<li>Weapon Types : Heavy Weapons 5, Staves 5, Polearms 5</li>
<li>Effect: Relentless as Water and pure as Earth, this technique calls upon Nature itself to shatter all barrages.

                <div >
                    <p>Tokugi are special techniques that can only be used by bushi. They function as highly specialized combat manoeuvers (such as Feint and Disarm) and represent the ultimate result of years of training. Unlike Kata, they are not stances but specific gestures, whose power rivalizes with the intricate design of Kihos. Performing a Tokugi is similar to performing a standard attack manoeuver (as a Complex Action), and can be activated either by Raising a number of times equal to the Tokugi’s Mastery Level, or by spending a Void Point.</p>
<p>It is possible to combine two or more Tokugi in a single strike, although doing so means taking great risks : one must make a number of Raises equal to the total number of Raises needed to perform all declared Tokugi separately. Furthermore, spending a Void Point on such a roll only negates the required Raises for a single Tokugi.</p>
<p>Purchasing Tokugi costs a number of Experience Points equal to the Tokugi’s Mastery Level. A bushi may only learn a Tokugi if their relevant Ring is equal to or higher than the listed Mastery Level. Additionally, a Tokugi may only be used with specific weapon types, and often needs a minimal number of skill ranks with said weapons to be performed.</p>
<p>A Bushi may not know more than one Tokugi per level. However, <a href="/kenshi-schools">Kenshi Schools</a> are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Only Tokugi with the Iaijutsu Skill may be used as part of the Strike phase of a Iaijutsu dueling, and only if the minimal number of Iaijutsu skill ranks is achieved. Tokugi used this way need to be declared during the Assessment part of the duel.</p>

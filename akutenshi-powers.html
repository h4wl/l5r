                <h4 class="display-4">Akutenshi Powers</h4>
                <hr />
                <h5 id="awe-of-the-dark-one">Awe of the Dark One</h5>
<p>The akutenshi may exert its will against other Shadowlands creatures, forcing them to do whatever it might desire. No die roll is needed. This power will work against any undead creature and any beast or oni of the Shadowlands, as well as against any Lost with lower Willpower. It will not work against Lost with equal or higher Willpower, nor against Tainted humans who are not Lost. This power cannot affect uniquely powerful creatures such as Oni Lords or other akutenshi.</p>
<h5 id="body-of-damned-time">Body of Damned Time</h5>
<p>The akutenshi can force those gazing upon it to see their own deaths. This power requires a Simple Action to use, and may target a number of opponents up to the akutenshi’s Taint Rank, all of whom must be able to see it. (Thus it will not work against blind opponents, for example.) Anyone who is affected by this power momentarily does not see the akutenshi, but instead a terrible void within which they can see their own future death. The akutenshi makes a Contested roll of its Taint against the Void of the targets; all targets who lose the roll immediately age by 1-10 years.</p>
<h5 id="breath-of-taint">Breath of Taint</h5>
<p>The akutenshi breaths forth an invisible cloud of pure Taint, corrupting and befouling everything it touches. The cloud can target any one creature within ten feet, forcing the target to make an Earth Roll at TN 25 or immediately gain 1-10 points of Taint. The breath can also be directed against a physical object (as large as a door or wagon), causing it to become Tainted – anyone subsequently touching that object must roll Earth at TN 15 or gain 1 point of Taint. Jade targeted with the Breath of Taint will instantly corrupt into black sludge, but crystal is immune.</p>
<h5 id="claim-the-body">Claim the Body</h5>
<p>The akutenshi has the ability to send out its spirit and possess other Shadowlands creatures, controlling them like puppets. The akutenshi remains aware of its own body (which is immobile and inactive) but can see, smell, feel, and otherwise sense everything the possessed creature perceives. This power can target any Shadowlands creature the akutenshi can see. If it has previously possessed a particular creature, it can now do so at any distance, even from all the way across the Empire. Each such possession attempt is a Simple Action and requires the akutenshi to win a Contested Willpower roll. If the possessed creature is killed, or the akutenshi’s body is harmed or disturbed, the akutenshi’s spirit immediately returns to its own body. It can also return to its own body voluntarily as a Free Action.</p>
<h5 id="mastery-of-darkness">Mastery of Darkness</h5>
<p>The akutenshi is a supreme master of the art of maho, and its spells are fearsomely powerful and effective. It knows all maho spells and can cast them without the need to spill blood. (If the akutenshi does spill blood to cast a maho spell, it gains 3 Free Raises on that spell.) In addition, the akutenshi can cast non-maho elemental spells as maho, although it must spill blood in the normal way to do so.</p>
<h5 id="passing-through-the-light">Passing Through the Light</h5>
<p>The akutenshi moves with inhuman and unnatural speed, to the point that it seems to warp or fall through space from one location to another. The akutenshi can move up to its Water x25 as a Free Action, and up to its Water x50 as a Simple Action.</p>
<h5 id="shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</h5>
<p>The akutenshi can freely alter its appearance, so long as it remains broadly human-like in size and shape. It can shift its body and features instantly, combining human and monstrous features, making itself as beautiful or as horrible as it desires. It can imitate anyone it has seen before, although its monstrous nature means that those familiar with the original person can try to see through the akutenshi’s deception (this is a Contested Roll, typically Investigation against the akutenshi’s Acting). Shapeshifting is a Free Action that may be taken any number of times each Round.</p>
<h5 id="soul-drinking">Soul Drinking</h5>
<p>The akutenshi can consume the soul of a victim, sucking it out through the mouth. This is normally done to a dying victim, but can also be employed against a living but helpless target by making a Contested Roll of the akutenshi’s Taint against the target’s Honor / Willpower. The consumed soul is stored within the akutenshi’s intestines, where it exists in endless torment and agony. Imprisoned souls can only be freed by killing the akutenshi.</p>
<h5 id="terror-of-fu-leng">Terror of Fu Leng</h5>
<p>The akutenshi unleashes a wave of monstrous, supernatural terror that freezes the blood of everyone within sight. Activating this power is a Complex Action and it affects everyone within line of sight. All targets are affl icted with a Fear 10 effect.</p>
